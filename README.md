# Clash of Slots
Quick and dirty (like eww...) implementation of a web-based application for visualizing free/blocked slots among a bunch of given time tables. Makes use of the Clipboard API (old non-async one) to quickly copy over time tables. Supports offline storage.

## How to use
1. Go to [vtopbeta.vit.ac.in](vtopbeta.vit.ac.in)
1. Open your timetable
1. `Ctrl+A` to select everything, `Ctrl+C` to copy
1. Return to this app and `Ctrl+V` to paste
